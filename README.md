## Explore And Visualize Yelp 

### Inspire
In this project, we explore the [Yelp dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset), especially the restaurant dataset, which contains food genres and ranking(from star 1 to 5). From [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset), we got the Yelp dataset and previous visualization demo which also inspired us to visualize the dataset. We would like to show the unique feature of our target cities. In order to show the features of our dataset, we choose Charlotte, Cleveland, Las Vegas, Madison, Montreal, Phoenix and Toronto to illustrate the diversity among Nothern America. 
### Insight
After processing the data, we clean it with python scripts and use the rating star score, coordinate, service time, food type, and restaurant type for further visualization process. Then, we find a unique feature for each city. For example, Las Vegas has the best buffet among those cities and has the longest serving time. Therefore, we gave a subtitle called 'The City Never Sleep' for Las Vegas. By providing the subtitle for each city, people who browse our website could easily know about the distinguished features through various kinds of charts(bar charts, coxcomb charts, light maps, etc.) for each city.
### Improve
In order to create a user-friendly interface, we use Bootstrap and Angular framework to create the website and charts. Also, we generate time slider maps for each city which give users a general idea of each city. With d3, we are able to create stacked bar charts. In addition, combining with the `dropdown` of Bootstrap, we realize the coxcomb charts which can be filtered, which means you can choose whatever food types, restaurant types or regions to compare the ratings and counts of those cuisines.
